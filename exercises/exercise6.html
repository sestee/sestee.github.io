        <h1>Exercise #1 by Sophia Estee</h1>
        <h2>Hi! My name is Sophia Estee. I am a junior year English major with a Concentration in Creative Writing & Specialization in Professional Writing & Technical Communications at UMass Amherst.</h2>
       
        <img src="../images/headshot.jpg" alt="Sophia Senior Portrait">

        <p>I am originally from Milton, MA, just outside of Boston. </p>
        <p>I love reading, writing, drawing, running & the gym, music, my dog Walter, iced coffee, sushi, and the beach.</p>
        <p>I love creative writing, especially poetry. I have taken multiple workshops that have allowed me to develop unique skills, perspectives, and portfolios. </p>
           <h2>Favorite Things</h2>
            <p>Some of my favorite classes at UMass so far include my Poetry 400 Workshop about creating spaces, Poetry 300 Workshop about humor, and a Fiction Workshop about memory. My favorite part about being an English major is the fact that I can use my over analyzation skills for good. </p>
                <p>My favorite novel to date is East of Eden by John Steinbeck. </p>
                <p>My favorite poet is Emily Dickinson.</p>
                <h2>Post-Graduation Plans</h2>
        <p>I hope to live in Boston post-graduation and work in communications or copywriting.</p>
